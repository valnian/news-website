    <h1>Major Scientific Discovery in Quantum Physics</h1>
    
    <div class="article-content">
        <p><em>By Dr. Sarah Johnson, Science Correspondent</em></p>
        <p><strong>June 15, 2023</strong> - In a development that has stunned the scientific community, researchers at the International Quantum Research Institute have announced a breakthrough that challenges fundamental assumptions about quantum entanglement.</p>
        
        <h2>The Discovery</h2>
        <p>The team, led by Professor Michael Chen, has demonstrated what they're calling "quantum coherence persistence" - the ability of entangled particles to maintain their connection under conditions previously thought impossible.</p>
        
        <p>"This changes everything," Professor Chen stated at yesterday's press conference. "We've essentially found that quantum entanglement can persist at macroscopic scales and for much longer durations than our models predicted."</p>
        
        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <p>The discovery opens doors to several potential technological advancements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantum computers with significantly improved stability</li>
            <li>Ultra-secure communication networks spanning continents</li>
            <li>New approaches to medical imaging at the molecular level</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a theoretical physicist not involved in the research, called the findings "the most significant development in quantum physics since Bell's theorem."</p>
        
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>The research team plans to submit their findings to <em>Nature Physics</em> next week. Independent verification experiments are already being planned at CERN and several other major research facilities worldwide.</p>
